<h1>Music <small>My top 20 of all time</small></h1>

<p>This was actually remarkably difficult.  I set off to select the 20 albums that had the largest impact on my life.
  This is what I came up with (in no particular order).</p>

<% @albums.each do |album|%>
   <hr>
   <div class="row">
     <div class="span4">
       <%= image_tag(album['image'], width: 120) %>
     </div>
     <div class="span5">
       <h3><%= album['artist'] %> <small><%= album['album'] %></small></h3>

       <p>I like music!</p>
     </div>
   </div>

<% end %>
