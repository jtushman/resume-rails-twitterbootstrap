    Been developing with Ruby and Rails for over 4 years.  I have never had more fun or have been more productive than
    I have been working with Ruby.  The DRY (don't repeat yourself) philosophy or Rails, combined with the elegance of
    Ruby make it such a killer combination.  Also, the supporting community (Thanks [Ryan](http://railscasts.com)!) really push to you to keep
    learning new libraries and hone your skills

- technology: MongoDB

    I have been really impressed with Mongo.  I love not having to deal with migrations anymore.  The DSL of
    [Mongoid](http://mongoid.org) makes my domain models easy to read, and modify.  The performance and scalability
    (at least for the types of applications that I have built) have been really impressive.  Plus, I have to give a
    shoutout to the folks at [MongoHQ](http://mongohq.com) who have phenominal support and have been great system admins for my projects

- technology: jQuery
  url: 'http://jquery.com/'

    As the browsers become more powerful, developers need to rely on javascript to give the users fast, responsive,
    and an impactful experience.  For now, jQuery is my library of choice

- technology: Heroku
  url: 'http://heroku.com/'

  description: |
    While not all my projects run on [Heroku](http://heroku.com), most do.  It really allows me to focus on the business-domain of the
    problem that I am solving, and leave the infrastructure to them.

- technology: Cucumber
  url: 'http://http://cukes.info//'

  description: |
    For a long time I resisted TDD/BDD.  When I was introducted to [Cucumber](http://cukes.info), that certainly changed.
    Cucumber promotes creating 'living' documentation that also serves as your test harness.
